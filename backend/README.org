* Productivity Scheme
Each member of the team is expected to work 10 hours per week. The member should record what they are working on, and how long they worked on it.

Each member will have the freedom to choose a feature / task to work on (unless there are some urgent tasks). To start working on a task, the member must first create a GitHub issue describing what the task entails. The member then branches off of the upstream branch to work on the task. Once the task is finished, the member submits a Pull Request (aka PR) to the ~dev~ branch and requests a PR Review from the backend lead. The PR will need to adhere to the criteria specified in [[*PR Approval Criteria][PR Approval Criteria]] in order to be approved.

Whoever creates the feature is responsible for maintaining it. We will do this to exploit the maintainers familiarity with the code, thus saving time.

By this we aim to increase the concurrency with which our team operates. Status updates will be discussed during weekly team meetings in order to facilitate discussion and to keep the bigger picture in mind.

Once a week, the backend lead will merge ~dev~ to ~master~.

** PR Approval Criteria
Here are the criteria the PR must adhere to in order to be accepted:

- No merge conflicts
- All tests are passing
- New features *must* come with unit tests
- No junk files are present (e.g. ~.vscode~)
- Directory hierarchy is followed
- PR commit message is [[*Commit Message Prefix][properly structured]]
  
** Commit Message Prefix
This applies to final commits (i.e. commits when merging to ~dev~):

| Commit Type | Issue Type        | Github Action    | Use Case                                               |
|-------------+-------------------+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------|
| feat        | <feature>         | close <issue nr> | Introduction of a new feature.                         |
| refactor    | <feature>         | close <issue nr> | Changing the implementation of an existing feature.    |
| fix         | <feature> / <bug> | close <issue nr> | Fixing a feature or a bug.                             |
| tests       | <feature>         | close <issue nr> | Adding / removing / changing tests.                    |
| docs        | x                 | x                | Documentation.                                         |
| misc        | x                 | x                | Miscellaneous (renaming of files, removing junk, etc.) |

An example merge commit message would be the following:

#+begin_example
feat(login, close #13): created login endpoint
#+end_example

* System Requirements
 We will be utilizing a traditional client-server architecture with a centralized database (as opposed to a distributed one), we will require a Virtual Private Server. The state of the project is still an MVP, hence we are not expecting a lot of users. Thus, the server does not need to be powerful; we prioritize cost over performance. A cheap configuration from a provider like [[https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/][Hetzner]] should suffice:

 | <c>  | <c>  | <c> | <c>  |   <c>   | <c>  |
 | Plan | vCPU | RAM | NVMe | Traffic | IPv4 |
 |------+------+-----+------+---------+------|
 | CX22 |  2   | 4GB | 40GB |  20TB   | Yes  |

 For a domain name we can use a [[https://afraid.org][free domain name provider]] with [[https://letsencrypt.org/][Let's Encrypt]] for a free SSL certification.

 We will be using [[https://github.com][Github]] for project management and version management. We will use [[https://whatsapp.com][WhatsApp]] as a communication channel and [[https://https://teams.microsoft.com][Microsoft Teams]] for communicating with our customer.

* Software Requirements
** Dependability
The backend should be resilient and avoid crashes.

** Security and Secrecy
Sensitive information should be encrypted on the server and can only be accessed by properly authenticated users.

** Performance on a Low-Scale
The backend should be capable of handling relatively low-workloads without outages and lagging.

** Programming Language: Golang
As a garbage-collected, system's programming language Golang has been proven to work exceptionally well in the industry as a backend language for many services. Additionally, it's simple syntax and extensive standard library made it an attractive option for our team's skill set.

Moreover, the developer tooling for the language is exceptional, allowing for an ergonomic developer experience when it comes to development, [[*Documentation][documentation]], and [[*Testing][testing]].

** Database: Sqlite
Sqlite is used extensively in the tech industry. It is extremely light-weight and simple to work with (due to the entire database being contained in a single file). It is a relational-database which fits perfectly with modeling a Project-Management system.

** Client-Server Authentication
Authentication between the client and the server will be done through session tokens which will be saved in our [[*Database: Sqlite][database]]. We decided that session tokens will be more appropriate than JWT, since our service is consolidated into one centralized service.

** Containerization: Podman
We will use the Podman to containerize our backend, due to Podman's rootless capabilities, open source nature and Kubernetes-like offerings. We will use podman's virtual bridging to isolate the database container entirely and partially isolate the Golang application.

The Golang backend will be a container called ~backend-prod~ with exposed port ~3100:443~. The Sqlite [[*Database Design][database file]] (~bricked-up_prod.db~) will be mounted as a _volume_ to ~backend-prod~.

Additionally, the [[*Documentation][backend docs]] will be in a container called ~backend-docs~ with exposed port ~6060:6060~.
   
** Reverse-Proxy: Nginx
We will use Nginx as a reverse-proxy due to its ease-of-configuration and performance. Assuming that our domain name is ~<brickedup>~  this will be the hierarchy of our sub-domains:

| <l>                      |      <c>       |                          <r> |
| Sub-Domain               | Localhost Port |                  Description |
|--------------------------+----------------+------------------------------|
| ~home.<brickedup>~         |     80,443     |             frontend's index |
| ~backend.<brickedup>~      |      3100      | backend's Golang application |
| ~docs.backend.<brickedup>~ |      6060      |               backend's [[*Documentation][docs]] |
| ~cicd.backend.<brickedup>~ |      7123      |        [[*Deployment][CI/CD]] for the backend |

** Repository Organization
Here is the directory hierarchy for the [[https://github.com/bricked-up/backend][backend]] repository:
- *src* - for main endpoint handling / routing
- *src/utils* - common utility functions
- *sql* - sql scripts to initiate database tables / populate database with dummy data


When developing, compile the code to a binary in the *bin* directory in the root of the repo. The lead will make sure that the *bin* directory will be ignored by Git, that way we do not push any unnecessary binaries.

* Database Design
The production database file will be called: ~bricked-up_prod.db~ and it will be located in the root of the repo (will live only on the server, all *.db files will be ignored by ~.gitignore~).

* Documentation
We will use [[https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc][godoc]] to generate documentation. This will be hosted on ~localhost:6060~.

* Testing
We will use Go's [[https://pkg.go.dev/testing][testing]] package.

** Unit Tests
All features should have unit tests.

** Integration Tests
 Integration tests checks if the communication between our services (e.g. our server and our database) is correct. A demo database will be populated from an SQL script with dummy data. The database file should be called ~bricked-up_test.db~ and it should be located in the root of the repository. The tests can now run queries on the testing database.
 
** TODO Fuzzing Tests

* Deployment
The following describes the full deployment pipeline (assuming task is complete and ready to be pushed upstream):

1. All [[*Testing][tests]] run successfully
2. [[*PR Approval Criteria][PR]] is submitted (tests are run on Github Actions to ensure everything works)
3. PR is reviewed by lead (must be accepted to continue)
4. Lead *squash merges* PR into ~dev~ branch (task issue is closed)
5. ~dev~ is *squash merged* to ~master~ branch (happens once a week)
6. once a change has been pushed to ~master~, a webhook is sent to our server's [[*Containerization: Podman][CI/CD]]
7. CI/CD program pulls changes and rebuilds backend on the server
